## Key Findings

- Anytype uses a local-first, offline-first architecture
- The system uses Protocol Buffers for data serialization
- CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for handling concurrent changes
- Service Locator pattern for dependency injection in the backend
- Component-based architecture with React in the frontend
- MobX for state management in the frontend (store pattern)
- Modular service architecture in the backend
- Event-based communication between components
- Factory pattern for block rendering in the frontend
- Multiple storage mechanisms in the backend
- P2P synchronization with CRDT conflict resolution

## Component Relationships

- Frontend (anytype-ts) communicates with backend (anytype-heart) via IPC
- Backend (anytype-heart) manages data using Protocol Buffer definitions from any-block
- CRDT-based changes are used for conflict resolution and syncing
- Protocol definitions (any-block) define the data structures for communication
- Sync infrastructure (anysync) enables data synchronization between devices
- Any-sync-dockercompose provides Docker configuration for self-hosting sync infrastructure

## Technical Architecture

- Client-server architecture with offline-first approach
- Protocol Buffers for structured data serialization
- Event-based communication for change notifications
- CRDT for conflict resolution in distributed environment
- Local data storage with multiple storage mechanisms
- P2P synchronization capabilities
- Component-based UI architecture with React
- Service-oriented backend architecture with Go
