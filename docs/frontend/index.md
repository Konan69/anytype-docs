# Frontend Documentation

This section contains detailed documentation about the Anytype frontend, which is built using TypeScript and React.

## State Management

The frontend uses MobX for state management, with several key stores:

- **Block Store** - Manages the block data within objects
- **Record Store** - Manages object records and their metadata
- **Common Store** - Handles application-wide state
- **Detail Store** - Manages UI details and view state

## Key Components

- **Editor** - Rich text editing capabilities
- **Object Views** - Different ways to view and interact with objects
- **Navigation** - Application navigation and routing
- **UI Components** - Reusable UI components
